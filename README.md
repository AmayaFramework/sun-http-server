# sun-http-server [![maven-central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.amayaframework/http-server?color=blue)](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/amayaframework/http-server/)

A repackaged and refactored sun http server, created in the original form by Oracle and formerly embedded in the jdk.
Distributed under the GNU v2 license.

This server, built on non-blocking sockets, is a perfect lightweight solution that has everything you need
for full use in various projects. Up to this point, it was ignored by most of the community due to its location
in sun packages. Now this restriction has been removed.

## Getting Started

To install it, you will need:

* Java 8+
* SLF4J implementation (optional)
* Maven/Gradle

## Installing

### Gradle dependency

```Groovy
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'io.github.amayaframework', name: 'http-server', version: 'LATEST'
}
```

### Maven dependency

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.amayaframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>http-server</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage example

The code below will start the server associated with the address localhost:8000.
There will be one handler on the server responding to a route starting with /hello.
The response will contain code 200 and an empty body.
He will respond to all other requests with the code 404.

```Java
public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        HttpServer server = Servers.httpServer(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
        server.createContext("/hello", exchange -> {
            exchange.sendResponseHeaders(HttpCode.OK, 0);
            exchange.close();
        });
        server.start();
    }
}
```
